## Description
This is the official repository for the paper [SE(3)-Stochastic Flow Matching for Protein Backbone Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02391). 

We propose a new family of [Flow Matching](https://openreview.net/forum?id=PqvMRDCJT9t) methods called FoldFlow tailored for distributions on SE(3) and with a focus on protein backbone generation. Our 3 proposed methods are:

- The first one is **FoldFlow-base**. Inspired by [Riemannian Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03660), we develop a Flow Matching approach to generate data living on SO(3) manifold.
- The second one is **FoldFlow-OT** which generalizes FoldFlow-base by drawing samples from a minibatch optimal transport coupling similar to [OT-CFM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00482).
- The third one is **FoldFlow-SFM**, a stochastic version of FoldFlow-OT.

Our experiments include: 
- Generation of synthetic SO(3) data.
- Protein backbone design.
- Equilibrium conformation generation.

> Note that our methods can be adapted for all applications where data live on the SO(3)/SE(3) manifold.

## Installation

Install dependencies
```bash
# clone project
git clone https://github.com/DreamFold/FoldFlow.git
cd FoldFlow

# [OPTIONAL] create conda environment
conda create -n foldflow python=3.9
conda activate foldflow

# install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

To run our jupyter notebooks, use the following commands after installing our package.
```bash
# install ipykernel
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel

# install conda env in jupyter notebooj
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=foldflow

# launch our notebooks with the foldflow kernel
```

## Current Code 
The current repository only contains toy experiments for learning an SO(3) multimodal density using all three FoldFlow models.

## Planned Updates
- [ ] Inference code for protein experiments
- [ ] Training code for protein experiments
- [ ] Equilibrium conformation generation
